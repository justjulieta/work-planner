# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

As a developer, I want to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code.

You'll need to use the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Day.js in the browser.

## Acceptance Criteria

When a user opens the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. As they scroll down, they will be presented with timeblocks for standard business hours (9am to 5am).
Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. The userthen will click into a timeblock to enter in an event and will ahve to click on the save button in order to save it to local storage.
